1. Prints out the value of the variable I, which is 3.
2. Prints out the value of the variable discountedprice, which is 150.
3. Prints out 150.
4. Returns array of discounted prices, with values [50, 100, 150]

6. Will print out 150 as the value df discountedPrice
7. Will print out 150 as the value of finalprice
8. The same array as before, [50, 100, 150]
9. Error, I is not defined
10. Prints out 3
